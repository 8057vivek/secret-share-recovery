## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

In this assignment, you'll work on a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm.

Consider an unknown polynomial of degree m. You would require m+1 roots of the polynomial to solve for the coefficients, represented as k = m + 1.

An unknown polynomial of degree m can be represented as:

```
f(x) = a_m x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + ... + a_1 x + c
```

Where:
- `f(x)` is the polynomial function
- `m` is the degree of the polynomial
- `a_m, a_{m-1}, ..., a_1, c` are coefficients (real numbers)
- `a_m â‰  0` (since it's the highest degree term)

The task is to find the constant term i.e., `c` of the polynomial with the given roots. However, the points are not provided directly but in a specific format.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Test Case:

```json
{
  "keys": {
    "n": 4,
    "k": 3
  },
  "1": {
    "base": "10",
    "value": "4"
  },
  "2": {
    "base": "2",
    "value": "111"
  },
  "3": {
    "base": "10",
    "value": "12"
  },
  "6": {
    "base": "4",
    "value": "213"
  }
}
```

### âž• Root Format Explanation:
```json
"2": {
  "base": "2",
  "value": "111"
}
```

Means:
- x = 2 (key)
- y = parseInt("111", 2) = 7
- So the point is (2, 7)

## âœ… You Can Use:

- Lagrange Interpolation  
- Matrix Method  
- Gaussian Elimination  

---

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Checkpoints:

1. **Read the Test Case (Input)** from a separate JSON file.
2. **Decode the Y Values** using the provided base.
3. **Find the Secret (`c`)** using any known interpolation method.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Constraints:

- All coefficients are positive integers.
- Coefficients fit in a 256-bit integer.
- n â‰¥ k always.
- Degree of the polynomial `m = k - 1`.

---

## âœ… Output

Print the constant term `c` (the secret) for **both test cases**.

---

## ðŸ§  Hint

You can verify your output manually by solving the polynomial using the decoded points.

    "n": 10,
    "k": 7
  },
